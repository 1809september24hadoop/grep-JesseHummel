1. cat cities.txt | grep -i '^z'
2. cat cities.txt | grep -i 'gan\>'
3. cat cities.txt | grep '^[ADE]'
4. cat cities.txt | grep -c '\<.ar'
5. cat cities.txt | grep -v '^C'
6. cat cities.txt | grep -E '\S{14}'
7. cat cities.txt | grep -c '^B'
8. cat cities.txt | grep d -o | wc -w

For the last two the $ wasn't working, so I used \> and it was giving me the right answers.
9. cat cities.txt | grep -E '(.)\1{1}\>'
10. cat testcities.txt | grep -E -i '^(.)(.).\2\1\>
